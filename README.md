# austin_seattle_weather
The aim of this repo is to create a visualization that will allow us to compare the rainfall in two American cities: Seattle, WA and Austin, TX.

seattle_weather.csv stores information about the weather in Seattle, and austin_weather.csv stores information about the weather in Austin. Each of these files was converted to a pandas DataFrames. Also, each of the DataFrames has a "MONTH" column that stores the three-letter name of the months. Each also has a column named "MLY-PRCP-NORMAL" that stores the average rainfall in each month during a ten-year period.
